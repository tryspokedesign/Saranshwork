            <p>We may terminate or suspend your account and bar access to Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, under our sole discretion, for any reason whatsoever and without limitation, including but not limited to a breach of Terms.</p>
            <p>If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Service.</p>
            <p>All provisions of Terms that by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>
            <h2>17. Governing Law</h2>
            <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of INDIA, which governing law applies to the agreement without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
            <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have had between us regarding Service.</p>
            <h2>18. Changes To Service</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to withdraw or amend our Service, and any service or material we provide via Service, in our sole discretion without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Service is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict access to some parts of the Service, or the entire Service, to users, including registered users.</p>
            <h2>19. Amendments To Terms</h2>
            <p>We may amend the Terms at any time by posting the amended terms on this site. It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically.</p>
            <p>Your continued use of the Platform following the posting of revised Terms means that you accept and agree to the changes. You are expected to check this page frequently so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.</p>
            <p>By continuing to access or use our Service after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use Service.</p>
            <h2>20. Waiver And Severability</h2>
            <p>No waiver by the Company of any term or condition set forth in Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of the Company to assert a right or provision under Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
            <p>If any provision of Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of Terms will continue in full force and effect.</p>
